<details> 
<Summary> <b><font size="+2"> Overview and Origin </font></b> </summary>
<ul>
<li> Fast tracked in Feb 2020 the company was founded by Christopher and James Kardatze</li>

<li> <font color="#1F5AF5">Quiver Quantitative</font> started as a hobby after they learned to code in high school. They posted their first data sets and visuals during their undergrad.</li>

<li> After their feature in Bloomberg they decided to turn their project into a business. At launch they had landed about <font color="#14DC5A">$100,000</font> and by the end of the year they raised another <font color="#14DC5A">$500,000</font>.</li>
</ul>

<Summary> <b><font size="+2"> Business Activities </font></b> </summary>

<ul>
<li> To make the clandestine insight surrounding corporate investments, lobbyists, and even stock trades among congressional members, that have been shielded by hedge funds and brokerage firms alike, more accessible and practical.</li>

<li>The target audience is retail investors, both laymen and professional alike. </li>

<li>By making this "alternative" data more accessible and offering api subscriptions.</li>

<li>Their expertise lies in employing data analytics and machine learning to scrutinize financial data, aiding their clients in making well-informed investment choices. They provide an array of products and services, encompassing data feeds, bespoke research reports, and investment software tools.</li>
</ul>

<Summary> <b><font size="+2">  Financial Landscape </font></b> </summary>

<ul>
<li> In general this fintech aims to disrupt and ultimately supplant conventional financial service providers by demonstrating greater agility, catering to an overlooked segment of the population, and delivering swifter/superior service.</li>

<li> Currently, the three most highly valued finanace companies utilizing a.i. are Ant Group, Stripe, and Revolut.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details> 
<Summary> <b><font size="+2"> Results </font></b> </summary>

<ul>
<li> Providing access to congressioanl investments, exposing trends of insider trading, government contract statements, and providing data sets and api that normally would not be available to the leyman. </li>

<li>Customer acquisition cost, customer lifetime value, and monthly recurring revenue are some of the core metrics used to mesaure companies in this branch of fintech. </li>

<li>Based on the limited resources available for comparison with other competitors in fintech, it appears they rank somewhere in the middle. Keeping in mind that they are a small business with only 15 employees and are not publicly traded. </li>
</ul>
</details>


<details> 
<Summary> <b><font size="+2"> Recommendations </font></b> </summary>

<ul>
<li>If their aim was to attract a broader audience, I would recommend providing their back testing program for free or at an entry-level price, albeit with limited access.</li>

<li>This avenue has the potential to assist individuals with minimal or no investment background in becoming more accustomed to the concept. Expanding the consumer base would directly influence profitability, along with other fundamental metrics in the fintech industry.</li>

<li>There wouldn't be a necessity for new software or hardware as it would leverage existing resources under their ownership and control. My proposal would merely alter the utilization and accessibility of their current programs.</li>
